===========
Syntactics:
===========
- variables and methods names: camelCase

- Controllers methods names: (replace 'Entity' or 'Entities' for the model Class name)
    GET one resource: getEntity.
    GET all resources: getAllEntities.
    POST one resource: postEntity.
    PUT one resource: updateEntity.
    DELETE one resource: deleteEntity.

- Service: all services shares 5 methods (with very few exception):
    public Entity get(int id);
    public List<Entity> getAll();
    public Entity insert(Entity entity);
    public Entity update(Entity entity);
    public Entity delete(int id);

Respect the default variables/methods disposition when create another POJO in the model 
(Use Person class as reference).

=================
Responsabilities:
=================

=========
Database:
