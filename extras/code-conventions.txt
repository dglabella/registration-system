===========
Syntactics:
===========
- variables and methods names: camelCase.

- Service: all services shares 5 methods:.
    public Entity getOne(int id);.
    public List<Entity> getAll();.
    public Entity insert(Entity entity);.
    public Entity update(Entity entity);.
    public Entity delete(int id);.

- Controllers methods names: (replace 'Entity' or 'Entities' for the model Class name) .
    GET one resource: getEntity.
    GET all resources: getAllEntities.
    POST one resource: postEntity.
    PUT one resource: updateEntity.
    DELETE one resource: deleteEntity.

- Models: no need to add explicit variables to store foreings key.

Respect the default variables/methods disposition when create another POJO in the model 
(Use Person class as reference).

=================
Responsabilities:
=================

Controllers: handle proper responses according to the services.

Services: handle bussines logic / uses cases.

Repositories: Customize queries if needed.

=========
Database:
=========
- tables should be named based on the class model name but in plural.
