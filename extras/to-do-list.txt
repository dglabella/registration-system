- validation: what about names/lastnames like d'alessandro

- log file for errors

- if person fields are updated, what about the QR information? should generate another one ?

- transient variables should not have setters and getters methods names beginning with "get..." or "set..."?

- check null param in services uses cases (like update weekly - WeeklyService: line 70) must be 
written in caller or in caller or callee?

- exist a jpa annotation for cascade logical deletion ?
