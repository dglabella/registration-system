- A service 'sx' for an entity 'x' can ONLY call a service 'sy' for an entity 'y' if 'x' associated directly to 'y'
(the intention here is modulate responsabilities for easy maintaining: when a use-case logic has to be modified)

- check if a body is null in service layer

- http status code errors must be coherent in all services

- on creation/update do not return data (not in all cases)

- can get users info no matter what PRIVILEGE has. Need fix

- fix domain diagram

- implement service entity

- log file for errors

- validation: what about names/lastnames like d'alessandro
